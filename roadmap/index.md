CaliOpen is under active development, this page is the reference roadmap.

Before a milestone starts, a reference page in this website is used to define
what needs to be done.

Once a milestone is started, the associated Trello board is used as reference.
Any task related with development is associated with one or more pull requests
on the associated repository. Each Pull Request is listed in the associated
Trello card.
