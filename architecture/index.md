Caliopen is a complete scalable messaging platform. Many components
interacts to complete all services and processes covered by this
platform.

Scalability is merely achieved using data store with such capability,
Cassandra for main storage, elasticsearch for indexing when it have to
be done.

A specific code architecture is defined to make component responsabilities
correctly isolated.
