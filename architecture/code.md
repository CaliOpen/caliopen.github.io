## Principles

Caliopen code must respect at least a 3 layers model:

* storage layer
    code responsible for data persistence in all storage engines (cassandra, elasticsearch).
* core layer
    code responsible for all data management methods. Storage is never directly used by
    a caliopen service, they must interact thru core classes related to data managed.
* protocol oriented layer
    code for a specific protocol service. HTTP REST API, LMTP, SMTP are such protocol oriented
    layer.

This layer structure impact on packaging logic to respect split of protocol layer and others, named
base layers. Same data may be managed thru many protocols.


# Repositories architecture
Below is our target repository structure.  
For now, all directories are not created, as some Caliopen's components are still missing or are not yet implemented.

### top level 
```
├── doc     : (work in progress) all documentation for developers, administrators and users
├── infra   : (to be done) tools to manage and supervise Caliopen platform
├── src     : all source code goes here
└── devtools: scripts, fixtures and other tools to build development environment
```

### the `src` directory
Source code for Caliopen platform and clients applications.  
**NB**: Caliopen is not bind to a specific language : one may finds softwares components written in python, Go, C, java… 

Caliopen is made of :

 * the *frontends* => applications that run on clients' devices : browsers, computers, smartphones…
 * the *backend* => the Caliopen platform that runs on servers.   
 
Here is our target architecture for `src` :
 
```
├── backend
│   ├── agents
│   ├── brokers
│   ├── configs
│   ├── components
│   ├── defs
│   ├── interfaces
│   ├── main
│   ├── protocols
│   ├── tests
│   └── tools
└── frontends
    ├── android_app
    ├── browser_extensions
    ├── ios_app
    └── web_application
```

## Code organization for the backend

#### `main` directory
The main application goes here. This is the entry point for the platform. From here, all relevant programs, servers and daemons are spawned, and core services/APIs are started.  
For now, there are 2 python packages : `main/py.main` and `main/py.storage`.  

To startup the Caliopen platform, run the command `main/startup` 
#### `interfaces` directory
Public APIs consumed by frontends and clients applications over HTTP/HTTP2.  
Examples : REST server, gRPC server…  
For now, there is a REST python server (pyramid) into `interfaces/REST/py.server`
#### `brokers` directory
Brokers are program modules that offer services to parse/unparse and/or unmarshall/marshall objects between the formal external protocol of the sender and the formal internal protocol of Caliopen.  
Examples : email broker, sms broker, vcard broker…
#### `protocols` directory
Program modules that implement standard protocols to connect *Brokers* to external tiers.  
Examples : SMTP, XMPP…
#### `components` directory
Software components that add features to Caliopen by exposing services or procedures directly to main processes.  
Each component can be enhanced thanks to a plugin architecture, as long as the plugin don't break the component's contract.  
Some components could be distributed outside Caliopen as standalone packages.  
Examples : parsers, messages qualifiers (PI computing, importance computing), keys manager, DNS…
#### `configs` directory
Configuration files for every platform components.
#### `defs` directory (ie definitions)
Interfaces, objects and methods definitions.  
One finds here the « Single Source of Truth » to work with Caliopen's inner world.  
Examples : databases models, protobuf files, python packages for base classes, Go struct definitions…
#### `agents` directory
Programs that run on-demand tasks and cron-jobs for main process and/or offer on-demand services to end-users.  
Example : credentials manager, notifier…
#### `tools` directory
Standalone programs to manage the backend and the databases outside the standard interfaces.  
Examples : caliopen CLI to import mailboxes…
#### `tests` directory
Test suits go there.

## Code organization for the frontends

#### `web_appliaction` directory
All the code needed to render and to distribute the User Interface that runs into the browser. For now, it is a *Node/Express/React* application.
#### `ios_app` directory
User Interface application for iOS. (to be implemented)
#### `android_app` directory
User Interface application for android devices. (to be implemented)
