This RFC describe how Privacy Index filtering is used between CaliOpen ReST API
and a Client.

## Resources

Resources using Privacy Index filtering are **Thread**, **Message** and **Contact**.

## Principle

An HTTP Header **X-Caliopen-PI** is used to give PI range wanted by an API Client.
Format for this header is an integer range between 0 and 100, inclusives values.
Values are separated using semi colon ';' character.

### Examples:

X-Caliopen-PI: 0;100 -> to retrieve all resources

X-Caliopen-PI: 50;100 -> to retrieve only resources having at least a PI value of 50

## Return code

API will reply with a 403 HTTP status code if a wanted resource PI do not fit into
PI filter range.
